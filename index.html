				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<img id="map" src="images/World%20Map.png">
				<p>
					Welcome to my tour of art showing different ways in which humans interact with the divine. This tour will travel through the rainforests of Peru, Shinto temples of Japan, a royal temple in China, and a ruined temple in Egypt in order to explore how humans have used art as a medium to interact with divine beings and to enhance those interactions. While some of the cultures that we will be exploring have not withstood the sands of time, the pieces and traditions associated with them have. As faith is so deeply rooted into who we are as people, we are lucky to still be able to see, hear, and otherwise experience these interactions with the divine that our human ancestors had created.

					This collection is a sample of icaros, traditional medicinal songs performed a capella in the Shipibo language. The Shipibo-Conibo shamans of the Peruvian rainforests, also known as vegetalistas, use the icaros in to call out to the gods like Pachamama, Viracocha, and other spirits of the jungle in ceremonies performed on a recipient to heal them physically, spiritually, or mentally. The most well-known ceremony is the ayahuasca ceremony in which the vegetalista creates a mix of highly hallucinatory plants called ayahuasca and administers it to the ill individual. The vegetalista then guides the recipient through their sacred journey by chanting the icaros, whistling, and occasionally using a schacapa – a rattle made from leaves and vines (Katz &#38 Dobkin de Rios, 1971). According to Dobkin de Rios and Katz, the vegetalista mathematically structures the sounds to create a “jungle gym” that keeps them within a set of restrained pathways (1975). This allows the participant to commune with the gods, without stretching beyond the intent of the ceremony.

				<p>
					The icaros allow the vegetalista to guide an individual suffering from an illness to request help from the gods and nature spirits of the surrounding jungle This shows that the Shipibo-Conibo believe that their gods are present in nature and that the vegetalista’s close connection to nature grants them the ability to channel the divine for the sick by calling out to them. This implies a close relationship between the gods and the people of the region, as well as a strong belief in the powers that the gods possess.

					This piece was recorded in the Takachiho Jinja, a Shinto shrine in the Miyazaki Prefecture of Japan. It is an example of a kagura – a genre of music and dancing that is intended to be entertainment for the gods. The presented kagura, Ame no Iwato, was created to be the music of the first kagure that was performed by the goddess Ame no Uzume after becoming possessed in order to trick Amaterasu Ômikami, the goddess of the sun, from a cave that she had hidden inside of. As all of the gods stood outside of the cave, Uzume danced to simple rhythm while removing her clothing. Once exposed, the other gods laughed hard enough to shake the ground which drove Amaterasu from the cave and restored light to the world (Akima, 1993. The music of the piece has a constant seductive melody played on the kagura-bue, a varying drum pattern that follows Uzume’s dance from a slow and steady pattern as she became possessed, moving to a rapid speed while exposing her nude body, and ending in a hurried pattern that anticipates Amaterasu exiting the cave.

				<p>
					The kagura reveal quite a bit about how the Shinto practitioners interact with and view their deities. These deities feel fear, have a sense of humor, can be tricked, can be become possessed by other supernatural entities, and can express themselves in a sexual manner. These qualities do not lessen their divinity or lower them to a human level, as the people feel it is their duty to entertain them with the kagura, but they do show that the gods have personalities – including frailties. In the legend, their true power is only seen in laughter that shakes the earth and a glow that lights the world; this makes them very important to the existence of the world without making them unapproachable.

					The Temple of Heaven in Beijing is one of two imperial temples that were used for a multitude of purposes since it was constructed during the Ming Dynasty in the early 15th Century. As the <a href="images/Temple-Of-Heaven-Map.jpg">temple</a> covers 273 ha of land with 92 buildings that include 600 rooms, we will focus on the Alter of Heaven. The altar is constructed of marble and is an open-air structure that consists of three concentric circular terraces (210 ft at the base) (Blodget, 1899). These circles represent Heaven and perfection, as the number three is associated with Heaven, Earth, and Man (Walker, 1992). The top of the altar is constructed of nine white marble slabs on which the emperor would kneel to address the gods, thus acting as a conduit between the gods and the people. The temple is dedicated to the Yang principle and was most importantly used during the winter solstice while its counterpart, the Temple of Earth, is dedicated to the Yin principle and was most importantly used during the summer solstice. While the most important ceremony was on the winter solstice, the temple’s many structures were used throughout the year for related rituals and ceremonies.

				<p>
					This temple is a marvelous example of how people interact with gods. The altar itself was made with the purpose of allowing the Son of Heaven (the emperor) to inform the gods of the years events on each winter solstice. This allowed the emperor to fulfill his role as the conduit between heavens and the people. As it is an imperial temple, every consideration was given to allow the structure itself to help the emperor make this divine connection. For instance, the nine slabs on top of the altar are very significant as the ninth hexagram of the I Ching, Nurturance of the Small, is constructed from the trigrams of Wind (submission) over Heaven (strength) (Cleary, 1986); this shows that emperor is strong but still submits to the will of the Heavens. In fact, nine was frequently associated with the emperors of China. This shows that while the emperor rules over man, the heavens rule over all of creation – the emperor himself included.

				<h2>Hatshepsut's Obelisk at Karnak</h2>
				<iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aub6KsOvYgo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>
					This impressive <a href="images/obelisk.jpg">obelisk</a> a was created under the orders of Hatshepsut – Queen and Pharaoh of all Egypt during the 15th century BCE. It is 97.5 ft tall and is constructed of a single piece of pink Assuan granite that weighs 343 tons. While now missing, the original was seamlessly coated in “fine gold” (electrum). The obelisk was dedicated to Hatshepsut’s fathers, Thutmose I (her earthly father) and Amun (her divine father). This obelisk has <a href="http://wsrp.usc.edu/information/REL499_2011/Karnak%20Obelisk%20Inscriptions%20of%20Hatshepsut.pdf">inscriptions</a> covering all sides of the monolithic construction and its base. These inscriptions are dictated by Hatshepsut herself and also taken from a speech from her to the people of Egypt. The obelisk was created as a symbol of Hatshepsut’s worth as the Pharoah, her dedication to the gods, and the magnificence of her reign. It was created out of rare materials such as electrum (gold with a high quantity of silver) and a single piece of granite so as to show that she would only give the absolute best to the Amun, just as she would only rule Egypt in the best possible way. 
				</p>
				<iframe class="map" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7575354.7818579!2d28.16975916851741!3d25.71331448041211!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x1449159228fec0cd%3A0xc71ae8c008c259d8!2sKarnak!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1533337075016" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>
					This piece is significant to the theme as it offers an interesting insight into a well-known culture in which many people are already aware of their gods and how the Pharaohs interact with them. As the inscriptions of the obelisk are still intact, we can see certain themes that reveal her relationship with the gods and the people as the only female Pharaoh. Many of her words reveal that her reign was not without dissent, and this dissent was likely due to her gender. Her comments, directed to the gods, seem more directed to the people that question her rule - such as repeated statements of how “he made me rule” (speaking of Amun) and in regard to the obelisk, “How like her it is, She is devoted to her father!” (Lichtheim, 2006). This shows that while she rightfully was of divine lineage, was the ruler of all of Egypt, and by her own words was beloved by her people, her gender was still able to interfere with people’s faith in her as a devout conduit to the gods. Her interaction with Amun through this piece is an assertion of the authority that she was rightly due and her devotion to all the gods of Egypt.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					While the cultures presented in this tour are from different times and different places, there are common themes that reflect strongly upon who we are as people. All of the native peoples of Peru and the Amazon have strong connections with nature. Their ideal entities live within the plants of the jungle, are responsive to pleas from people that respect nature, and they compassionately heal those that see the nature as their mother and provider. Those of Shinto faith see their gods as people with feelings and emotions like themselves, but with bigger responsibilities; this makes it natural that the people felt as if the gods deserved to be entertained so that they can enjoy the world that they maintain for everyone. The emperor, divine in nature themselves, had a more formal relationship with his heavenly patrons. The reports that he gave to the gods are not unlike a business report being given to management; it allows the heavens to respond appropriately to the needs of the people when the emperor could not handle the issue themselves and for him to report the deeds that he did accomplish. The emperor is familiar with the grave responsibility of leadership and treated the gods with the respect that he believed due to those holding such heavy burdens. The same burden weighed down on Hatshepsut, along with the same sexism that many women experience today in their fields – adding an additional level of difficult to her already challenging life. This lead her to assert her right to rule, her dedication, and her own divinity through a massive monolith made of the finest materials and with the most exceptional craftsmanship available that jutted into the sky above those that would question her divine rule. While this obelisk also reveals her own insecurities, it also proves to the gods, the people, and herself that she is fit take her place next to Amun and all of the Pharaohs before her and that she will be remembered for her magnificent rule for the rest of history just as the gods will be forever remembered – the fact that this obelisk still stands as proof that her assertions were correct.
				</p>
				<p>
					While it is difficult for many modern people to understand the faith and devotion necessary to create music, monoliths, or architectural wonders that span hundreds of hectares of space, interactions with the divine forces of the universe have shaped who we are as people. Like art, this faith in the divine crosses all borders, spans throughout time, and is something that is a unifying factor between all people as it appeals to the very nature of human identity. While we now turn our faith and devotion to other deific forces, our art still reflects this deep belief that something greater than our individual selves exist. This can be seen in a webpage designer spreading her creative vision across the globe by publishing a website or at an EDM festival where a crowd consisting of thousands of people from across the globe dance to the same rhythm as it passes through their bodies. This new form of interaction and creation is in many ways the same as when a sculptor formed the body of a god with his hands; we are making something in our own image – something that all people can understand and appreciate, something that will hold the same meaning regardless of where or when it is experienced, and something that shows who we are as human beings.
